What is dumping ?
In computing, a core dump, crash dump, memory dump, or system dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time, generally when the program has crashed or otherwise terminated abnormally. core dump is a file of a computerâ€™s documented memory of when a program or computer crashed. The file consists of the recorded status of the working memory at an explicit time, usually close to when the system crashed or when the program ended atypically.

Aside from the entire system memory or just part of the program that aborted, a core dump file may include additional information such as:

    The processor's state
    The processor register's contents
    Memory management information
    The program's counter and stack pointer
    Operating system and processor information and flags
